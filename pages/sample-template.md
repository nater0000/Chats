I would want to paste the prompt here where it's not too large and overpowering...

gpt@remote:~${:.terminal-line .matrix .gpt}
I probably want to paste the response into this spot  
and whatever formatting is here will hopefully show up beautifully...

Then another prompt could go here

gpt@remote:~${:.terminal-line .matrix .gpt}
And the next response  
Would be here and all formatted
