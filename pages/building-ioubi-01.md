title: Building IOUBI
author: NathanR
prompt: Are you able to use the methodological approach suggestions from ‘Methodological Sustainability’ Knowledge Base and apply it to the ‘Healing Money’ Knowledge Base to suggest a focused entry point to building ‘IOUBI’ as described in the ‘Healing Money’ Knowledge Base? For personal context, I am a professional software engineer with 20 years of experience mostly in C/C++ but I prefer a javascript based solution for convenience. How can I plan, build, and implement the ‘IOUBI’ ecosystem and transparent monitoring software. Would you recommend a blockchain like DAO or is there simpler ways to create a Minimal Viable Product or a prototype of some sort so that I can begin experimenting with it in my personal life?

solution: To build IOUBI as described in the 'Healing Money' Knowledge Base, follow this structured approach tailored to JavaScript for simplicity and rapid prototyping:

### **1. Understand Core Requirements**
- **IOUBI Definition**: A decentralized system enabling tokenized I-O-Us (BIDI tokens) with smart contracts for rules like interest or due dates.
- **Key Features**:
  - Token-based debt representation.
  - Smart contract enforcement of terms.
  - Transparency and security via blockchain.

### **2. Technology Stack Selection**
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Use for prototyping, leveraging Ethereum or Truffle for smart contracts and web3 libraries.
- **Blockchain Options**:
  - **DAO (Ethereum)**: For decentralized trust but may require gas fees.
  - **Local State Database (LevelDB/SQLite)**: For MVP to avoid blockchain overhead.

### **3. Development Phases**
#### **Phase 1: Local MVP with LevelDB**
- **Tools**: Write in Node.js using LevelDB for local state persistence.
- **Example Code**:
  ```js
  const level = require('level');
  const db = level('/path/to/db');

  db.put('user1', '10 BIDI')
    .then(() => db.get('user1'))
    .then(value => console.log(`User 1 has: ${value}`))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
  ```
- **Smart Contract (Optional)**:
  Deploy a basic ERC-20 token on Ethereum for later integration:
  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
  interface IERC20 {
      function transfer(address, uint256) external returns(bool);
  }
  
  contract IOUBIToken is IERC20 {
      mapping(address => uint) balances;
      function transfer(address _to, uint _amount) public override returns(bool) {
          balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
          balances[_to] += _amount;
          return true;
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Phase 2: Decentralize with Ethereum**
- **Setup Truffle/Remix**: Compile smart contracts for deployment.
- **Smart Contract Features**:
  - Interest calculations (e.g., using interest-bearing tokens).
  - Due date enforcement via timestamp checks.

#### **Phase 3: Scalability & Privacy**
- Transition to Hyperledger Fabric or a permissioned Ethereum network for enterprise-level security.

### **4. Security & Sustainability**
- **Environmental Impact**: Use Ethereum 2.0 (proof-of-stake) or other eco-friendly protocols.
- **Decentralization**: Avoid central authorities; use consensus mechanisms like PoS.

### **5. User Experience**
- **Frontend**: React.js for web applications with web3 integration.
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask for user wallet management.

### **6. Testing & Iteration**
- **Local Testing**: Use Ganache for Ethereum testing.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regularly audit contracts for security (e.g., using Slither).

### **Code Snippet (JavaScript + LevelDB)**
```js
const level = require('level');
const db = level('/path/to/db');

db.put('user1', '10 BIDI')
  .then(() => db.get('user1'))
  .then(value => console.log(`User 1 has: ${value}`))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

### **Recommendation**
Leverage JavaScript for prototyping with a local LevelDB backend. Transition to Ethereum-based smart contracts later. This approach balances simplicity, scalability, and alignment with 'Healing Money' principles. 

**Alternative Approach**: Use Chainlink oracles for real-time monitoring of interest rates or external data.
