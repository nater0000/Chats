This value structure for a "Moneyless Society" is ambitious and well-intentioned, laying a strong philosophical foundation for a community-driven organization that seeks to operate outside of traditional capitalist norms. However, there are several strengths and potential areas for improvement:

Strengths:
Clear Vision and Purpose: The document outlines a clear shift from current societal values (e.g., hyper-individualism, competition, hierarchy) toward more cooperative and inclusive ones (e.g., interdependence, collaboration, sociocracy). This value-driven framework is essential for creating a cohesive organizational culture.

Participatory and Dynamic Approach: The method of evolving shared values via community discussion and consent is democratic and participatory. It empowers members to actively shape the organization's culture, which is important in a decentralized society.

Commitment to Accountability: By promoting transparency, mutual respect, and ethical responsibilities, the structure acknowledges the importance of accountability to both internal and external stakeholders, including the Earth, volunteers, and supporters.

Trauma-Informed and Growth-Oriented: Emphasizing personal development and collective healing, especially around trauma, shows a progressive and empathetic approach to conflict resolution and personal accountability.

Contrast with Existing Systems: The use of comparison between "current societal values" and the aspirational values (e.g., competition vs. collaboration) provides clarity, making it easier for members to understand the behavioral changes needed.

Areas for Improvement:
Complexity of Process:

Bureaucratic Layers: The steps to propose, discuss, and formalize new values could become overly bureaucratic, especially if the organization grows. While fostering discussion is key, the process may slow down decision-making, especially in time-sensitive situations.
Consent Complexity: The focus on obtaining consent for shared values is important, but it could create potential bottlenecks or disagreements if a single member can block consensus. Exploring alternative consent frameworks (e.g., sociocratic consent) might help balance inclusivity with efficiency.
Operationalizing Values:

While the document presents admirable values, how these will be operationalized isn't always clear. For example, how will the organization ensure that volunteers and members embody these values consistently, especially in stressful or high-stakes situations?
It would be helpful to outline more specific, measurable behaviors and practices that members can follow, making the value-based behaviors more tangible and easier to adopt.
Sociocracy vs. Hierarchy:

The shift from "hierarchy" to "sociocracy" is presented as a complete break from traditional structures. However, sociocratic systems can still feature roles of authority or decision-making positions that could be interpreted as hierarchical. A clearer explanation of how decision-making will be distributed might prevent confusion or unrealistic expectations about total equality.
Ambiguity in Moral Neutrality:

The document states that no value is “morally good” or “bad,” which can lead to confusion. While this sentiment fosters a non-judgmental attitude, it may weaken the organization's moral clarity, especially when tackling complex ethical issues. It might be more effective to clarify that while no person is morally judged, the behaviors associated with certain values can have positive or negative social impacts.
Generalizing of Existing Values:

Some of the descriptions of "current societal values" (e.g., hyper-individualism, competition, privatization) are framed in ways that could seem oversimplified or overly negative. Not all competition or individualism, for instance, is destructive. More nuance could help balance the critique of the existing systems while making space for individuals who may still see value in some of those traits.
Conflict Resolution Process:

The conflict resolution process is essential, but it feels a bit vague in terms of enforcement and outcomes. The process for requiring a member to take a hiatus, for instance, could benefit from more explicit criteria for when this action is necessary and how disagreements will be mediated without alienating individuals.
Lack of Addressing External Integration:

While the focus on internal behavior is strong, there is little detail on how the organization will interact with external systems, especially capitalist institutions. As most members will still need to navigate a world driven by money, some guidance on external relations could be useful.
Additional Recommendations:
Provide Examples: It might help to provide real-world examples or case studies of how these values can be applied in practice. This would give members a clearer sense of what it means to "operate in a feedback loop" or "collaborate out of a desire for sustainability."

Ongoing Feedback Mechanism: Establish an iterative feedback system (perhaps tied to the organization's regular meetings or community check-ins) that continually assesses whether the values are being upheld and what challenges are arising in their implementation.

Training and Development: Since many of these values represent significant shifts from the status quo, formal training or onboarding programs might be necessary to help new members adapt to these new ways of thinking and behaving.

Legal and Logistical Considerations: Lastly, some of the ethical responsibilities (e.g., transparency with finances, privacy accommodations in mediation) should be backed up with clear legal or logistical frameworks to ensure compliance and protect the organization.

Conclusion:
The values structure is visionary and thoughtfully developed, aiming to foster a compassionate, sustainable, and equitable community. However, its success will depend on how well it can balance idealism with practical, actionable steps, particularly around governance, conflict resolution, and scaling decision-making processes. By streamlining the decision-making process, adding clarity to operational practices, and providing more specific guidance on behavior, the Moneyless Society can build a solid foundation for enacting its ambitious vision.
