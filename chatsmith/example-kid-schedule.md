For children in the 4th and 5th grades, it's generally recommended to limit screen time to no more than 1-2 hours per day, especially close to bedtime. Here's a proposed schedule based on their school dismissal and hobbies:

**Proposed Daily Schedule:**

**3:35pm - Arrive Home**
- **3:35pm - 4:00pm:** Quick snack and unwind from the school day (relax, chat about their day).

**4:00pm - 5:00pm: Homework/Reading Time**
- Focus on schoolwork or quiet reading. This ensures any academic responsibilities are taken care of early.

**5:00pm - 6:00pm: Playtime / Exercise / Outdoor Activities**
- Encourage outdoor play or physical activities to burn off energy and keep them active.

**6:00pm - 6:30pm: Screen Time (Games/YouTube)**
- Limit screen time to 30 minutes before dinner to relax and have some fun.

**6:30pm - 7:30pm: Family Time / Creative Activities**
- Engage in family games, puzzles, or creative activities that donâ€™t involve screens.

**7:30pm - 8:00pm: Calm Activities**
- Begin winding down for dinner. This could include helping set the table, light reading, or other relaxing activities.

**8:00pm - 8:30pm: Dinner**
- Family dinner time.

**8:30pm - 9:00pm: Relax Post-Dinner**
- Gentle activities like storytime, board games, or a calming chat with parents.

**9:00pm - 9:30pm: Night Routine/Bedtime Prep**
- This includes brushing teeth, getting into pajamas, and calming activities like a bedtime story.

**9:30pm: Lights Out/Bedtime**
- Ensure they get a good night's sleep.

This schedule ensures minimal screen time before bed, allowing for a relaxed and healthy routine leading up to dinner and bedtime.
