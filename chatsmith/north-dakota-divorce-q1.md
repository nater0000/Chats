title: Achieving Allimony

---
In North Dakota, like in many places, whether or not a woman (or any spouse) is awarded alimony—also known as spousal support—depends on numerous factors set forth by the court. The decision isn't based solely on whether the spouse contributed directly to the income during the marriage. Instead, it looks at various aspects such as:

1. **Length of the Marriage**: Longer marriages are more likely to result in an alimony award.
2. **Earning Capacity**: The court considers each spouse's earning potential and whether one spouse sacrificed their career or education for the marriage.
3. **Standard of Living**: Maintenance of the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage is another consideration.
4. **Financial Needs and Resources**: The court evaluates both parties' financial situations.
5. **Contributions to the Marriage**: This includes non-monetary contributions like homemaking, child-rearing, and supporting the other spouse's career.
6. **Age and Health**: The overall health and age of each spouse might impact the decision.

In terms of strategy, successful cases where a spouse receives alimony often involve:

- **Documentation**: Keeping detailed records of all contributions, financial and otherwise, made during the marriage.
- **Demonstrating Need**: Clearly showing a need for financial support, possibly due to a lack of marketable skills or the need to care for children.
- **Professional Testimonies**: Using vocational experts to testify about the non-working spouse's job prospects.
- **Legal Representation**: Having a knowledgeable lawyer to navigate complex divorce law and negotiate favorably.
- **Equitable Distribution**: Arguing for a fair division of property can also impact spousal support agreements.

Each case is unique, and outcomes can vary significantly based on individual circumstances. It's highly recommended to consult with a family law attorney in North Dakota to get advice tailored to the specifics of any divorce situation.
