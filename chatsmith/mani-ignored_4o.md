The prophet Mani and Manichaeism are often overlooked in modern Christianity for several reasons:

1. **Historical Condemnation**: Early Christian leaders and councils condemned Manichaeism as heretical. Augustine of Hippo, an influential Christian theologian, was a former Manichaean who later repudiated the religion and criticized it extensively.

2. **Theological Differences**: Manichaeism presents a dualistic worldview, where good and evil are seen as two fundamental forces. This contrasts sharply with Christian teachings, which emphasize a single, omnipotent God and the inherent goodness of creation.

3. **Decline and Persecution**: Manichaeism declined due to systematic persecution by both the Roman Empire and various other states. This suppression included burning of Manichaean texts and execution of its followers, leading to its near-extinction.

4. **Distinctive Practices**: Manichaeism incorporated elements from multiple religions, including Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism. This eclectic approach didnâ€™t align with the more unified doctrines of mainstream Christian denominations.

5. **Limited Texts and Influence**: Few Manichaean texts have survived to the present, limiting its influence on contemporary thought. In contrast, Christian texts have been preserved, studied, and disseminated widely.

These factors combined to marginalize Mani and his teachings within the broader narrative of Christian history.
