The point on the globe that is opposite to a specific location is called its antipodal point. However, the antipodal point of Point Nemo doesn't have a specific name as Point Nemo does. 

To find the antipodal point, you simply take the latitude and longitude of the original point (Point Nemo, in this case) and convert them:
- Latitude becomes the opposite hemisphere (e.g., from 45° S to 45° N).
- Longitude is subtracted from 180° and the hemisphere is flipped (e.g., from 123° W to 57° E).

Point Nemo is located at approximately 48°52.6' S and 123°23.6' W. Its antipodal point would be around 48°52.6' N and 56°36.4' E.

The antipodal point of Point Nemo lands in Central Asia, near the border between Russia and Kazakhstan, in an area that doesn’t have a specific designation akin to Point Nemo. This area is largely continental, contrasting Point Nemo’s oceanic location.
