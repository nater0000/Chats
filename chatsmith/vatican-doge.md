The Doge (pronounced "DOHJ") has no official role in the Vatican. The term "Doge" refers specifically to the elected chief of state and leader of the Republic of Venice from the 8th to the 18th century. This position was unique to Venice and its governance.

The Doge's primary responsibilities included:

1. **Political Leadership**: Acting as the head of state and leading the government of Venice.
2. **Military Oversight**: Commanding the Venetian navy and overseeing military matters.
3. **Diplomacy**: Representing Venice in foreign affairs and negotiating with other states.

The Doge and the Pope of the Vatican were often influential figures in their respective regions, but their roles were distinct and separate, representing different forms of authority and governance.
