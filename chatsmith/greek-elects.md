In ancient Greek city-states, local governance was often characterized by varying degrees of citizen participation, which could differ significantly from one city-state (polis) to another. Here are the main formats through which citizens could influence governance:

1. **Democratic Structures**: Athens is the most famous example, known for its direct democracy. Citizenship allowed for active participation in the Assembly (Ecclesia), where Athenian males could engage in decision-making on laws, policies, and important issues. Positions such as the Archons and council members (Boule) were often filled by lot (sortition) or election, intending to reflect broad representation.

2. **Oligarchic Structures**: In other city-states like Sparta, governance was more oligarchic. Power was concentrated among a few elite families. Spartans had two kings and a council of elders (Gerousia), chosen for life, which dominated decision-making. While there was an Assembly, its powers were limited compared to Athens.

3. **Mixed Systems**: Many city-states had mixed systems combining elements of democracy and oligarchy. For example, Corinth had elected magistrates but also a council composed of aristocrats influencing decisions.

4. **Direct Participation**: Beyond formal institutions, citizens could influence governance through direct participation in the Assembly or other bodies. Public discourse, debates, and citizen proposals played crucial roles in governance, especially in democratic polities.

5. **Popular Courts**: In Athens, large pools of citizen jurors decided legal cases, providing a judicial check on governance. These courts had significant power and allowed citizens another direct influence method.

Overall, while the elective element was present, especially in offices requiring some expertise, direct participation and sortition were also crucial in promoting broader citizen involvement and reducing elite domination in decision-making.
