Democratizing modern legal representation is indeed a complex challenge, especially when considering factors like entrenched power structures, unequal wealth distribution, and the influence of historical precedents on our current systems. However, there are several approaches that could potentially contribute towards a more democratized system:

1. **Campaign Finance Reform**: Implementing strict limits on campaign financing could reduce the influence of wealthy families and corporations. Public funding for campaigns could also level the playing field, enabling more diverse candidates to participate in elections without financial barriers.

2. **Lobbying Regulations**: Tightening regulations around lobbying and the revolving door between corporate interests and legislative bodies could minimize the influence of money on policy decisions.

3. **Ranked-Choice Voting**: This voting system allows voters to rank candidates by preference. It can encourage more diverse and representative candidates to run for office, potentially leading to more inclusive representation.

4. **Proportional Representation**: Many democracies use proportional representation systems where parties gain seats in accordance with the percentage of votes they receive, rather than winner-takes-all. This system could better reflect the electorate's preferences.

5. **Grassroots Movements and Local Governance**: Encouraging strong and active grassroots movements can empower communities to push for change from the bottom up. Local governance and decision-making can be enhanced by participatory budgeting and other democratic innovations.

6. **Direct Democracy**: Implementing more direct democracy mechanisms, such as referenda and initiatives, can give citizens a more direct voice in decision-making processes. Digital platforms can facilitate direct participation in discussions, voting, and policy formulation.

7. **Educational Reform**: Promoting civic education can empower citizens with the knowledge and skills needed to engage effectively in democratic processes. A well-informed electorate is crucial for challenging entrenched powers and demanding more democratic systems.

8. **Decentralization**: Decentralizing power from central governments to local communities can allow for more tailored and responsive decision-making, empowering people to have more say in issues that directly affect them.

9. **Strengthening Institutions**: Ensuring that democratic institutions are independent, transparent, and accountable is essential for a fair representation. Voting rights need to be protected, and measures against disenfranchisement should be enforced.

10. **Legal and Constitutional Reforms**: In some cases, legal frameworks may need to be revised to reflect democratic principles better and ensure genuine representation for all citizens.

Achieving these changes requires a concerted effort from both individuals and collective movements committed to long-term activism and advocacy. It involves voters, activists, policymakers, and innovative thinkers working towards a shared vision of a truly democratized society. While these measures can face significant resistance, sustained pressure and a well-informed public can gradually shift the balance towards a more democratic system.
