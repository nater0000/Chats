Certainly! The period from 1200 to 1600 saw significant developments in the foundations of democratic governance, although full-fledged democracies as we understand them today did not exist at that time. Here's a closer look at that period:

1. **13th Century**:
   - **Magna Carta (1215)**: Signed by King John of England, the Magna Carta established the idea that the king's power was not absolute. This document included provisions for the protection of certain legal rights, laying groundwork for the rule of law and influencing future democratic documents.
   - **Development of Parliament**: In the latter part of the century, the English Parliament began to develop from the traditional royal council. Initially, it was mainly a venue for the king to announce decisions and collect taxes, but over time it evolved to include representatives from different regions.

2. **14th Century**:
   - **Parliamentary Growth**: The English Parliament grew in power, gradually gaining more influence in governance, especially concerning taxation. The Model Parliament of 1295 had set a precedent for including representatives from the boroughs and counties, which continued into the 14th century.

3. **15th Century**:
   - **Further Parliamentary Influence**: The English Wars of the Roses (1455–1487) saw parliament’s influence wax and wane depending on the ruling house, but helped in solidifying its role in governance. The ability to grant or withhold taxes was a key parliamentary power by this time.

4. **16th Century**:
   - **Reformation and Religious Influence**: The Protestant Reformation severely affected governance structures in Europe, with religious authority being questioned and leading to broader political reforms. This period saw increased discussions about the rights of individuals and governance structures.
   - **Tudor Monarchs**: While the Tudor kings and queens (1485–1603) often ruled with strong authority, they still required parliamentary support for financial and certain legal matters. This interplay laid further groundwork that would eventually limit royal power.
   - **Early Constitutionalism**: Writers and philosophers began to articulate theories about governance and the rights of individuals, although widespread implementation of these ideas would come later.

Overall, from 1200 to 1600, the core ideas of limited power and representative advisory councils helped shape future democratic developments, with parliaments evolving from mere advisory bodies to fundamental structures within governance systems.
