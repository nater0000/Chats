The Romantic period, which spanned from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, was characterized by a profound shift in focus across various aspects of life and art. It was marked by an emphasis on emotion, individualism, nature, and a reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment.

### Topics of Focus for People Living Through the Romantic Period:

1. **Emotion and Individualism**: Romanticism celebrated intense emotion and the individual experience. People began valuing personal expression and the uniqueness of individuals.

2. **Nature**: A deep appreciation for the beauty and power of nature was central to Romantic thought. Nature was often seen as a source of inspiration and spiritual renewal.

3. **The Past and Exotic**: Romantics had a fascination with history, medievalism, and the exotic. Folklore, myth, and distant lands were common themes.

4. **The Supernatural**: Interest in the supernatural, mysticism, and the fantastical emerged, with ghost stories, legends, and folklore gaining popularity.

5. **Rebellion and Revolution**: The era coincided with several political revolutions, including the French and American revolutions. Romantics often supported ideas of liberty and rebellion against oppressive structures.

### Difference in Focus Between Artists and Common People:

- **Artists and Poets**: Romantic artists, poets, and musicians, such as William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Ludwig van Beethoven, were primarily focused on expressing personal emotion and individualism. They often explored abstract and imaginative themes and were not typically concerned with the practical, everyday lives of ordinary people.

- **Common People**: The general populace, however, was more concerned with immediate and practical matters, such as economic conditions, agricultural advancements, and the broader impact of the Industrial Revolution. While inspired by romantic ideals, their day-to-day lives were occupied with survival, work, and community.

### Authors and Their Backgrounds:

Some Romantic artists and authors came from common backgrounds but used their unique insights and experiences to appeal to broader themes. However, many were also well-educated, affluent, or connected to influential circles, enabling them to focus on artistic endeavors. 

Overall, while the romantic ideals permeated both artistic and popular perspectives to some extent, there was often a distinction in focus, driven by economic, social, and educational differences. Artists could afford to delve deep into the themes of emotion and individualism, while common people navigated the realities of daily life, sometimes drawing inspiration from Romantic works.
