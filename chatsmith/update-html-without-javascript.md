Web developers typically rely on JavaScript for dynamic updates to HTML content because it's naturally designed for client-side interactions. However, streaming HTML component changes using PHP without JavaScript can be accomplished, but it is less interactive and usually relies on server-side techniques. Here are some methods to achieve this:

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) with PHP
Server-Sent Events allow servers to push updates to the client. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using PHP:

1. **PHP File for SSE (`sse.php`):**
    ```php
    <?php
    header('Content-Type: text/event-stream');
    header('Cache-Control: no-cache');

    // Function to emit events
    function sendMsg($id, $message) {
        echo "id: $id" . PHP_EOL;
        echo "data: $message" . PHP_EOL . PHP_EOL;
        flush();
    }

    // Simulate data streaming
    $counter = 0;
    while (true) {
        sendMsg($counter++, 'New data at ' . date('H:i:s'));
        sleep(1); // Delay for the next event
    }
    ?>
    ```

2. **HTML File (`index.html`):**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
        <title>SSE with PHP</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="data"></div>
        <iframe src="sse.php" style="display:none"></iframe>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

   In the example above, an iframe is used to include the server-sent events without using JavaScript. However, it's not a true dynamic update but a hack.

### Auto-Refresh Meta Tag
Another approach is to use the `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="seconds">` tag to refresh the page or a portion of it periodically:

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5"> <!-- Refreshes the page every 5 seconds -->
```

### PHP-Only Solution (with Limitations)
Without JavaScript, you can use PHP to reload the entire page or specific components by implementing logic on the server side:

1. **HTML Form to Reload Page:**
    ```html
    <form method="POST">
        <input type="submit" value="Refresh Content">
    </form>
    ```

2. **Processing the Form in PHP:**
    ```php
    <?php
    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
        // Fetch and display new content
        echo 'New content here: ' . date('H:i:s');
    }
    ?>
    ```

### Conclusion
While it's possible to stream HTML component changes using PHP without JavaScript, it's not as seamless and interactive. Typically, JavaScript or frameworks like AJAX, WebSockets, or front-end libraries are used for such tasks because they provide a more responsive and dynamic user experience.
