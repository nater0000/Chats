Venice is known for its unique and complex political system, which evolved over several centuries. Some important dates associated with the early governance and "elections" among the nobility and wealthy merchants in Venice include:

1. **697**: The establishment of the first doge (leader) of Venice. Though initially a hereditary position, the election of the doge eventually became an elaborate process involving a limited electorate.

2. **1172**: The formation of the Great Council (Maggior Consiglio), the main governing body, composed of nobles. Initially, membership in the Great Council was by appointment, but it later became hereditary.

3. **1268**: The introduction of a more formalized and complex electoral process for choosing the doge, involving multiple rounds of voting and selection by lot among members of the Great Council. This process ensured that various factions within the nobility had a voice, although it was not democratic by modern standards.

4. **1297**: The year of the "Serrata" (closure) of the Great Council, which significantly restricted membership to a hereditary class of noble families, formalizing the oligarchic nature of Venetian governance.

These dates mark significant moments in Venetian governance, reflecting the evolution of its electoral system. The process was intricate but intended to balance power among the most influential families, rather than representing a broad electorate.
