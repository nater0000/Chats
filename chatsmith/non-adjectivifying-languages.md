Languages that tend to have limited or no productive morphological processes for turning nouns into adjectives might include some of the following:

1. **Mandarin Chinese:** Chinese is more analytic, relying heavily on word order and function words instead of inflectional morphology. Adjectival forms are often separate words rather than derived from nouns.

2. **Vietnamese:** Similar to Chinese, Vietnamese is an analytic language and typically uses separate words to perform adjectival functions rather than changing the form of a noun.

3. **Thai:** Language structure in Thai often relies on separate modifiers rather than derivational morphology to create adjectives from nouns.

4. **English (to a lesser extent):** While English does have noun-to-adjective transformations (e.g., "nation" to "national"), compared to more synthetic languages, it uses compounding and modification rather than extensive morphological changes.

5. **Hawaiian:** Hawaiian uses compounding and possessive constructions to express adjectival meanings rather than noun-derived adjectives.

These languages rely more on syntax and less on morphology for expressing what could be adjectival transformations. However, even within these languages, lexical borrowing and calquing from other languages can introduce noun-to-adjective transformations to varying extents. Essentially, while they may have methods to denote similar concepts, they typically don't have robust morphological systems specific for this transformation.
