Voting for parliament has roots that go back many centuries, evolving gradually over time. Here's a brief overview:

1. **England's Early Parliaments**:
   - **13th Century**: The concept of a parliamentary body in England began to take shape in the late 13th century. The Model Parliament of 1295, summoned by King Edward I, included commoners, nobles, and clergy.
   - **Representation of Boroughs**: This period saw the beginnings of the idea that towns (boroughs) should send representatives (burgesses) to discuss and consent to taxes and legislation.

2. **Development of Parliamentary Elections**:
   - **Late Medieval Era**: By the 14th century, elections for representatives to serve in the English Parliament became more structured, although the right to vote was highly restricted, generally to landowners and influential citizens.
   - **Evolution Over Centuries**: The nature of voting rights and who could stand for election evolved over the centuries, influenced by shifts in power and changes in societal structures.

3. **Expansion of the Franchise**:
   - **Reform Acts in the UK**: Key reforms, like the Reform Acts of 1832, 1867, and 1884 in the United Kingdom, gradually expanded the electoral franchise to more men, including middle and working-class men.
   - **Women's Suffrage**: Womenâ€™s right to vote came later, notably achieved with the Representation of the People Act 1918 in the UK, which initially allowed women over 30 to vote, followed by equal suffrage in 1928.

4. **Voting in Other Countries**:
   - **Continental Europe**: Other European countries also developed parliamentary systems with voting over time, with variations based on local history, culture, and political climates.
   - **Global Spread**: The model of parliamentary elections spread globally, especially in countries influenced by European colonization and subsequent independence movements.

In summary, while the exact origins and developments of voting for parliament vary globally, the concept began in medieval England with significant evolution and expansion over subsequent centuries, culminating in more inclusive democratic systems worldwide.
