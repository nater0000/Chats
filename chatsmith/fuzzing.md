Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is a software testing technique used to discover security vulnerabilities and bugs by inputting massive amounts of random data, or "fuzz," into a program. The aim is to identify errors like crashes, memory leaks, or unforeseen behaviors that developers might not anticipate through regular testing methods. Here's how it plays a role in computer security:

1. **Automated Testing**: Fuzzers automatically generate data inputs to ensure a wide array of scenarios are tested, making the process efficient and thorough.

2. **Vulnerability Detection**: By exposing the software to unexpected or invalid inputs, fuzzing can uncover weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, like buffer overflows or improper input validation.

3. **Quality Assurance**: Beyond security, fuzzing helps improve the overall robustness of software, ensuring it handles exceptional situations gracefully.

4. **Types of Fuzzing**:
   - **Mutation-Based**: Modifies existing data samples to create new test inputs.
   - **Generation-Based**: Constructs inputs from scratch, based on defined input models.

5. **Popular Tools**: Common fuzzing tools include American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), OSS-Fuzz, and Microsoftâ€™s Systems Security Tools.

6. **Integration**: Fuzzing is often integrated into continuous integration (CI) pipelines to ensure ongoing security as changes are made to the codebase.

By continuously inputting random data, fuzzing serves as a proactive defense mechanism, identifying potential vulnerabilities before attackers have a chance to exploit them.
