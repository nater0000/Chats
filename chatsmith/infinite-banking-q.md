The concept of "infinite banking," as discussed in many financial articles, including those from sources like NerdWallet, revolves around using a whole life insurance policy as a personal banking system. Here are some common yet potentially unexpected aspects to consider which may be less obvious due to potential biases or incentives by authors:

1. **High Initial Costs**: Whole life insurance policies often have higher premiums than term life insurance. The costs can be substantial in the early years, which can be a deterrent for some.

2. **Complicated Policy Structures**: These strategies are complex and require a deep understanding of cash value life insurance. Many consumers may find it challenging to fully grasp the intricacies without expert advice.

3. **Commission Incentives**: Agents selling these policies may receive significant commissions, creating a potential conflict of interest. This could influence the way the benefits and downsides of such strategies are presented.

4. **Illiquidity of Cash Value**: Whole life policies may not provide as much liquidity as implied. Accessing the cash value often involves loans, which incurs interest and affects the policy's death benefit.

5. **Opportunity Costs**: By tying up funds in a life insurance policy, there might be a missed opportunity to invest in other potentially higher-yielding assets.

6. **Long-Term Commitment**: These policies are generally designed to be held for the long term. Exiting prematurely can result in loss of the premiums paid and potential surrender charges.

7. **Policy Loan Implications**: Taking loans against the policy's cash value can be beneficial but also tricky. If not managed, it can lead to lapses in policy or diminished returns.

8. **Overemphasis on Tax Benefits**: While there are tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth and tax-free loans, they should not overshadow the need for a comprehensive financial strategy.

9. **Variable Returns**: The performance and dividends from whole life policies can vary considerably, and they may not always meet the policyholder's expectations.

10. **Complex Financial Ecosystem**: There are other financial products or strategies that might serve similar purposes with different risk/return profiles, and these should be compared comprehensively.

By understanding these elements, readers can make more informed decisions, assessing infinite banking in the context of their broader financial goals. Always consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who isn't directly benefiting from selling such products for a more unbiased viewpoint.
