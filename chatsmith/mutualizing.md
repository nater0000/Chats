The process of mutualizing, or transitioning companies and properties from private ownership to collective ownership, is a complex and multifaceted undertaking. It would likely involve several key steps and principles such as:

1. **Legal and Policy Framework**: Implement legal reforms to support the transfer of ownership structures. This might involve enacting laws that favor cooperative models, providing incentives for businesses to convert, or disincentives for maintaining traditional capitalist structures.

2. **Valuation and Compensation**: Develop a fair system for valuing existing businesses and properties. Compensation mechanisms need to be established for current owners to ensure a just transition. This could involve using bonds, phased payments, or other forms of compensation.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with a wide range of stakeholders including current owners, employees, consumers, and the wider community. Establish clear communication channels and participatory processes to ensure that the interests and concerns of all parties are considered.

4. **Education and Training**: Invest in education and training programs to prepare workers and communities for new ownership roles. Knowledge on managing cooperatives, democratic decision-making, and financial literacy will be crucial.

5. **Financial Support and Infrastructure**: Provide financial support through loans, grants, or subsidies to assist in the transition to collective ownership. Establish infrastructure to support new cooperative enterprises, such as cooperative banks or technical assistance networks.

6. **Pilot and Scale**: Start with pilot projects to test the mutualization process on a smaller scale. Evaluate these initiatives, learn from them, and gradually scale up successful models to larger enterprises and industries.

7. **Cultural Shift**: Foster a cultural shift towards valuing collective ownership and cooperative principles. This can be promoted through media, education, and public campaigns that highlight the benefits of mutualized systems.

8. **Long-term Governance Structures**: Develop long-term governance structures that maintain democratic control and accountability. This might involve creating boards or councils with representatives from workers, consumers, and the community to oversee enterprises.

9. **Regulatory Oversight and Support**: Establish governmental or independent bodies to oversee the transition, ensure compliance with new laws, and provide ongoing support and regulation.

10. **International Cooperation and Solidarity**: Engage with international organizations and movements to gain support and learn from other countries that have undergone similar transitions.

This process would be challenging, requiring strong political will, widespread public support, and careful planning. It must also respect legal and human rights principles to ensure an equitable and peaceful transition.
