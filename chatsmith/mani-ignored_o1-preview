Mani was a 3rd-century Persian prophet and the founder of Manichaeism, a syncretic religion that combined elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism. Manichaeism was once widespread and influential, particularly during the late Roman Empire. However, it is largely ignored in modern Christianity for several reasons:

1. **Considered Heretical**: Early Christian authorities deemed Manichaeism heretical because it presented a dualistic worldview that contradicted core Christian doctrines. Mani taught that the world is a battleground between equal forces of good and evil, which conflicts with the Christian belief in an omnipotent, benevolent God.

2. **Suppression by the Church**: The early Christian Church actively opposed Manichaeism. Church leaders like Augustine of Hippo, who was a former Manichaean before converting to Christianity, wrote extensively against it. Over time, the Church's efforts led to the decline of Manichaeism in the West.

3. **Lack of Integration into Christian Theology**: Unlike some other movements or teachings that were absorbed or reinterpreted within mainstream Christianity, Manichaeism remained distinct and was never integrated into Christian doctrine.

4. **Historical Decline**: Manichaeism eventually disappeared as an organized religion by the 14th century, partly due to persecution and the rise of Islam in regions where it was practiced. Its decline meant that it had little lasting influence on Christian thought.

5. **Scriptural Canonization**: The development of the Christian biblical canon excluded Manichaean texts. As a result, its teachings did not become part of the authoritative scriptures used in Christian worship and education.

Modern Christianity focuses on doctrines and teachings that align with its established beliefs. Since Manichaeism was considered outside of these beliefs and was historically opposed by the Church, it remains largely unacknowledged in contemporary Christian practice and theology.
